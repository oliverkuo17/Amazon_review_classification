# Amazon_review_classification
Use machine learning algorithms to build models to classify the helpfulness for Amazon online eviews

There are many Amazon online reviews, which might be helpful, but never been seen by customers.
The goal of this project is to create models to imprvoe the online reviews recommandation system.

This project strats with data exploration and preparation.
Then, text mining techniques are applied (Sentimental Analysis, Topic Modelling, Singular Value Decomposition)

After data is prepared, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are used to build classifiers.
Hold-out and k-fold cross validation are used to evaluate the performance of each classifier.
ROC is drawn to evaluate the classifiers as well.
